# Patent Buddy

An app that helps users **determine if their idea is patentable** and guides them through the patent discovery and assessment process.

## Goals

- Let users describe their invention and get an initial patentability assessment
- Explain patent criteria (novelty, non-obviousness, utility) in plain language
- Help users understand next steps (prior art search, patent attorney, provisional vs. non-provisional)

## Project

Planned and tracked in [Linear](https://linear.app/mike-gelber/project/patent-buddy-632335249bf0).
