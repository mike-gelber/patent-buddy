Title:       Smart Garden Irrigation System with AI-Powered
             Weather-Predictive Soil Moisture Control

Inventor:    Jane Doe

Reference:   INV-2026-0042

------------------------------------------------------------
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION
------------------------------------------------------------

This invention relates generally to automated garden
irrigation systems and, more specifically, to an intelligent
irrigation controller that combines real-time soil sensor
data with machine-learning-based weather predictions to
optimize watering schedules for residential and commercial
gardens.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------

Existing irrigation systems typically rely on simple timers
or basic moisture thresholds. These approaches waste water
because they do not account for upcoming weather conditions,
soil type, plant species, or historical water-uptake
patterns. Smart irrigation controllers on the market today
either require cloud connectivity for all decisions (adding
latency and a single point of failure) or operate purely on
local sensor data without predictive capability.

There is a need for a self-contained, solar-powered
irrigation controller that performs edge-AI inference locally
while also leveraging cloud-based weather forecasts when
connectivity is available.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
------------------------------------------------------------

The present invention provides:

  a) A sensor module containing soil moisture, temperature,
     humidity, and light intensity sensors communicating via
     Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 5.0) mesh networking.

  b) An edge-AI processing unit running a TensorFlow Lite
     model that fuses real-time sensor readings with 5-day
     weather forecast data (ingested via Wi-Fi or LoRa) to
     generate predictive watering schedules.

  c) A zone-based irrigation actuator with solenoid valves,
     flow-rate sensors, and a fail-safe pressure-regulated
     shutoff mechanism triggered by anomaly detection.

  d) A solar-powered energy subsystem (5 W panel + Li-Ion
     18650 battery) enabling fully self-contained outdoor
     deployment without external power.

  e) A cloud intelligence platform for fleet management,
     deep-learning model retraining, and a mobile companion
     application allowing manual schedule overrides and live
     sensor monitoring.

4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Sensor Module
    - Capacitive soil moisture sensor (range 0–100 % VWC)
    - DS18B20 digital temperature probe (–55 °C to +125 °C)
    - SHT31 humidity sensor (0–100 % RH, ±2 % accuracy)
    - LDR-based light intensity sensor (0–100 klux)
    - nRF52840 SoC providing BLE 5.0 mesh with AES-128

4.2 AI Processing Unit
    - ESP32-S3 dual-core MCU @ 240 MHz, 8 MB PSRAM
    - TFLite Micro runtime for on-device inference
    - Predictive model: LSTM-based time-series network
      trained on 18 months of regional weather + soil data
    - Inputs: current sensor vector, 120-hour weather
      forecast (temperature, precipitation probability,
      humidity, wind speed)
    - Output: per-zone watering duration (minutes) and
      optimal start time for next 24 hours
    - Fallback: rule-based threshold irrigation when
      connectivity is unavailable for > 48 hours

4.3 Irrigation Actuator
    - 4-zone solenoid valve manifold (12 V, 0.5 A per zone)
    - YF-S201 hall-effect flow-rate sensor per zone
    - Adjustable pressure regulator (10–50 PSI)
    - Anomaly detection: if measured flow deviates > 30 %
      from expected, the fail-safe shutoff engages and an
      alert is sent to the mobile app

4.4 Power System
    - 5 W monocrystalline solar panel (6 V output)
    - MPPT charge controller (efficiency > 95 %)
    - 2 × 18650 Li-Ion cells in parallel (7000 mAh total)
    - Low-power sleep mode: < 50 µA; active duty cycle ~2 %

4.5 Cloud Platform & Mobile App
    - MQTT over TLS 1.3 for device ↔ cloud communication
    - AWS IoT Core + Lambda for data ingestion
    - Model retraining pipeline: weekly incremental updates
      using federated learning across opt-in devices
    - React Native mobile app (iOS & Android):
      schedule override, live sensor dashboard, water-usage
      history, push notifications for anomalies
